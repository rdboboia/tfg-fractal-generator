# tfg-fractal-generator

This is the application developed with my final grade project. The applicaiton generates in real time the Mandelbrot Set and lets you explore it freely. The executable JAR is uploaded in case you want to try it out by yourself.

There are still many things I'd like to change, improve and do, so I'll try to keep updating it.

Since there is no license specified (for now), all rights are reserved. But while I think about the license I'm letting you take a quick peek at the code. That is, you can download the app an try it by yourself, but the code is not under an open source lincese (for now).
